Steps
1. start.spring.io -> details and dependencies (lombok, JPA, MySQL driver, Spring Web)
2. Unzipped
3. opened in IntelliJ
4. DB connection details
5. Start coding

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update || create || verify
update -> everytime we run the system, only new changes are updated
create -> everytime we run the system, drop all the tables and then re-create them with current changes
verify -> verify whether the DB has required tables and columns as per entities

For all dependent objects -> we use annotation called @Component
but if they also do something specific -> @Repository, @Service

For controllers which support RestAPIs -> @RestController
For simple controllers which does not support REST APIs -> @Controller

DTOs are supposed to be used by Controller layer only, service and repository layer should not deal with DTOs, they should only deal with internal models
